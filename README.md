# The Story Behind This Project
It all started when I realized that I wasn't feeling good about myself and my productivity. I needed a way to track my deep work sessions, specifically the time spent on focused study. By doing so, I hoped to gain confidence and boost my self-esteem. I wasn't sure how much time I was truly dedicating to my studies each day. And worse, I feared I might not be working as hard as I thought.

At the same time, I felt an urge to start contributing more actively on GitHubâ€”building something meaningful that could help me grow, learn, and share with others. So, I thought, why not combine the two?

What if I could create a program that tracks my deep work duration? This would not only help me measure my progress but also serve as a tool for self-development. And as I was learning Linux, I thought it would be awesome to build this program in a terminal-based environmentâ€”just like the Linux tools I was studying.

This project became my start. I wanted to put it on GitHub so others could also contribute to its growth. By doing so, I envisioned a tool that could help anyone looking to track their focus and study time, and improve themselves day by day. It could even have features like tracking new English words learned each day or other self-improvement features!

How It Works
This project uses a simple list-based data structure to help you track your deep work sessions. It stores your data in a .json file thatâ€™s automatically created on your desktop. You can interact with it using terminal-style commands.


## Project Status
This project is a work in progress. Some features are incomplete or experimental. If you encounter bugs, please report them as issues, and we will address them when possible.
